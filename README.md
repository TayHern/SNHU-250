## Agile Methodologies Review
&nbsp; &nbsp; In order to effectively incorporate user needs into a program, the first step is to identify the target audience and understand the specific objective at hand. For example, when working on the ChadaTech project, the goal was to develop a travel website for users to plan their upcoming trips through SNHU Travel. In following the agile approach, the use of "user stories" was essential. These user stories allowed me to empathize with the user's perspective and outline the features and functionalities that I aimed to incorporate.

&nbsp; &nbsp; As a developer, I had some understanding of agile processes from previous experience, but I didn't fully grasp the methodology. In the past, I conducted daily meetings with myself and the board to discuss tasks in progress, review, and completed. Recognizing that I had already been using agile practices in my current approach, I've gained more confidence in my programming. I also intend to take this further by actively seeking feedback from peers to identify areas for improvement and to develop better programs in the future.

&nbsp; &nbsp; A key aspect of being a valuable team member in software development is the ability to adapt and communicate effectively. Communication is crucial for the team's success. Equally important is the willingness to acknowledge one's own shortcomings and take responsibility for one's actions rather than passing the blame. Asking for help demonstrates a commitment to learning and adapting, ultimately leading to improved overall team performance.
